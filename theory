Natural electric fields are present and ubiqitious on the earth. 
Electric fields occur between the ground and upper atmosphere (the ionosphere). 
This forms the ionosphere-earth waveguide (some 70 km altitude) with the ground surface and grounded subsurface to some depth (skin depth).
The skin-depth represents the amplitude decay rate from the surface ground, which is dependent on only the ground impedence and peroid. 
Ground impedence relates the electrical conductivity (inversely, resistivity) to the skin depth and can be approximated by the frequency. 
For instance,
